# Principles



File over app: Content lives in portable Markdown files, not locked in proprietary formats. This site will outlive whatever platform hosts it.
Designed to last: Built with stable technologies for the long term. No frameworks to deprecate, no dependencies to break, no features requiring constant maintenance.
What else can I remove?: Every design decision starts with subtraction. Remove JavaScript, analytics, custom fonts, animations. What remains is what matters.
Sustainability: Every byte costs energy. System fonts eliminate requests. Compressed images reduce transfer. No JavaScript saves processing. At 5.46 KB, this page achieves an A+ carbon rating—less than 0.01g CO2 per view.
Content-driven layout: Generous whitespace serves reading. No decoration competes with words and images.
